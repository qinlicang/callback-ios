### PhoneGap has been accepted into the Apache Software Foundation for incubation as Apache Cordova, where it will remain free and open source. This will ensure open, independent stewardship of the project over the long term.

---

You can now find all the code at the Apache Incubator Cordova Project repository on GitHub [http://github.com/cordova](http://github.com/cordova). Please add it as a remote to keep up to date and/or contribute during the incubation period. Thank you for your patience during this transition!
